	<h2>Following content is cover on this class</h2>
	
	<ol>
		<li>CDN - simply called Content Delivery Network. Deliver/share the content. Like below image which liked to a CDN, you can check the link which is not local file but linkrd to a external site.
			<br><img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2020/04/05/10/50/uganda-5005579_960_720.jpg" width="300" alt="Image from CDN">
			<br>Note: Always choose free site for the image to avoid copywrite issue.</li>
		<li>Image <span>"name"</span> and <span>"alt"</span> could help in SEO. Aslo help in accesibility like for blind person with voice as write in <span>"alt"</span></li>
		<li>Image resoulation should be as small as possible, to make the faster. If you give higher resoulation image it will take more time to load</li>
		<li>Image sizing is possible using <span>"width"</span> and <span>"height"</span> attribute. Measurement unit is px=pixel, pt= point, %=percent, 1em=16pixel and rem. Default is px(pixel). Mean if you set only value without any unit, it will take pixel automatically. Try only <span>"width"</span> attribute to control image size and leave the height as auto. Otherwise image will srink</li>
		<li>Attribute cannot be set in all tag/element. Like we cannot assign <span>"src"</span> in <span>&#60;h1&#62;</span> tag.</li>
		<li>Boolean attribute <span>&#60;input type="text/email/submit/checkbox" disable/checked/readonly&#62;</span>. Used to collect user input as true or false and also for control of user input. Various boolean attribute: <span>disable, readonly, checked, enable, autoplay,</span> etc. For example: </li>
			<ul>
				<li>Checkbox with default checked: <input type="checkbox" checked></li>
				<li>Checkbox with default unchecked: <input type="checkbox" ></li>
				<li>Input field but disabled: <input type="text" value="you cannot write here becasue its disabled" disabled></li>
				<li>Button field disabled: <input type="submit" value="Submit" disabled></li>
				<li>Button field enabled: <input type="submit" value="Submit"></li>
			</ul>
		
		<li>Link up a portion of HTML. <span>&#60;a href="http://google.com"&#62; Click Here to go to goole&#60;/a&#62;</span>. This can be used for any link like, inside and outside.<br>
			For Example: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sunshuvo">Search me on Google</a>
		</li>
		<li>Code commenting. <span>&#60;!-- some note, which only show in code to describe about code --&#62;</span>. In my code I write same comment which is not showing here, but if you go to code view or inspect this section you can see that.<!-- some note, which only show in code to describe about code --></li>
		<li>CSS: Simply known as Cascading style Sheet. It used to style or layout the web pages or presenting content in own way.
